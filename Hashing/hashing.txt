* Methods:- 
    -> Linear Probing (collision handled by taking next index using a fixed offset)
    -> Chaining (collision can be handled by linkedlist)
    -> Resizing the list -> (Collision can be handled by resizing the list by using threshold)
    -> quadratic probing,
    -> bucket method, 
    -> random probing, and 
    -> key rehashing
